# 2 - Logical Synthesis ‚Äì Digital Transmitter ASIC Flow

This section documents the **logical synthesis phase** of the RTL-to-GDSII flow, focusing on transforming a high-level RTL design into an optimized gate-level netlist, 
ready for physical implementation.

---

## üìå 2.1 Overview and Purpose

The **Logical Synthesis** stage is the **first major milestone** in the ASIC digital implementation flow. Its purpose is to convert 
the behavioral-level **RTL code** into a **technology-mapped gate-level netlist**, using a specific **standard cell library** (SAED 14nm in this project).

üîç This step ensures the design is:

* Optimized for **Power, Performance, and Area (PPA)**
* Ready for **physical implementation**, including placement and routing
* Aligned with key design constraints: timing, area, and power

Logical synthesis plays a crucial role in determining downstream success in achieving **timing closure**, **power efficiency**, and **area optimization**.

---

## üéØ 2.2 Synthesis Goals

During synthesis, the following critical objectives are targeted:

*  **Functional Equivalence**
  Ensure the gate-level netlist maintains the intended RTL functionality.

*  **Timing Closure**
  Meet **setup** constraints across all operating conditions.

*  **Area Efficiency**
  Minimize logic depth and gate count to reduce silicon usage.

*  **Power Optimization**
  Lower both **dynamic** and **static** power consumption.

*  **Clock Definition**
  Define clock domains, periods, and propagation for later stages.

## üõ†Ô∏è 2.3 EDA Tool: Synopsys Design Compiler

Synthesis is conducted using **Synopsys Design Compiler (DC)** ‚Äî a widely adopted tool for logic synthesis. Its features used in this project include:

* Constraint-driven **logic optimization**
* Support for **multi-clock** and **multi-voltage** domains
* Incremental synthesis for design updates
* Integration with **DesignWare** IP and **SAED 14nm** standard cell libraries

## üìå Summary

Logical synthesis bridges the gap between high-level design and physical implementation by producing a **functionally correct**, **technology-aware**, 
and **performance-optimized** gate-level representation. It is a cornerstone of digital ASIC design that directly impacts the success of all subsequent stages 
in the RTL-to-GDSII flow.

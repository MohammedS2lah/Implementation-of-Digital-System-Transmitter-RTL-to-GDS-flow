# Routing Stage

The **Routing Stage** is a critical milestone in the digital physical design flow, transforming abstract connectivity (netlist) into real-world metal paths over silicon. Following placement and clock tree synthesis (CTS), routing physically wires together all the design components ‚Äî standard cells, macros, and IOs ‚Äî while adhering to electrical and geometric design constraints.

---

## üìå Overview

Routing finalizes the physical implementation by establishing signal, power, and clock connections across designated metal layers. It directly influences timing, signal integrity, power consumption, and manufacturability. The stage includes both global routing (resource estimation and path planning) and detailed routing (precise layer/via assignment).

---

## üéØ Purpose

The main purpose of the routing stage is to:
-  **Complete connectivity** for all nets defined in the synthesized netlist.
-  **Respect foundry design rules** for spacing, widths, and via constraints.
-  **Maintain timing integrity** by optimizing path delays and reducing parasitics.
-  **Reduce noise and crosstalk**, particularly for sensitive and critical nets.
-  **Balance metal layer usage** to prevent congestion and promote routing quality.

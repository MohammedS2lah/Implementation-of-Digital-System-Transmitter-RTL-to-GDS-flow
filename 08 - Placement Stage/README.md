# Placement Stage

The **Placement** stage is a key milestone in the RTL-to-GDSII physical implementation flow. It translates the synthesized gate-level netlist into actual physical positions for standard cells within the defined floorplan. Placement plays a crucial role in determining both the timing and routability of the final layout, serving as the foundation for subsequent steps like CTS and routing.

## üìå Overview

In this stage, all standard cells are assigned legal, optimized locations on the die that respect:
- Floorplan boundaries.
- Power planning structures (rings, straps).
- Pre-placed macros or hard IP blocks.

The placement engine leverages physical-aware optimization to strike a balance between timing, area utilization, and congestion.

## üéØ Purpose

The main purpose of placement is to:
-  **Legally position** all standard cells within the floorplan grid.
-  **Preserve logical connectivity** while optimizing net lengths.
-  **Enhance timing closure** by reducing delays across critical paths.
-  **Avoid congestion** by distributing cells efficiently.
-  **Prepare for CTS**, ensuring enough whitespace around clock sinks.

## üéØ Targets

During placement, the following design goals are pursued:

| Target               | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  Timing Optimization | Place cells to minimize setup and hold violations                          |
|  Congestion Avoidance | Avoid dense routing areas by spreading out high-activity logic blocks      |
|  Legalization        | Ensure all cells align to placement sites and avoid forbidden areas         |
|  Power Awareness     | Maintain alignment with power grid structures and macro pin access points   |

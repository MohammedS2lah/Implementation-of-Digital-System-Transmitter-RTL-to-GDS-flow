# Floorplanning Stage

The Floorplanning stage initiates the physical implementation process in ASIC design. It establishes the physical structure, layout boundaries, and macro placement that the rest of the flow (placement, CTS, routing) will build upon. A strong floorplan directly improves timing, area efficiency, routability, and power delivery.

## üìå Overview

**Floorplanning** is the first major physical step after the NDM setup. It involves defining:
- The **core area** and **die dimensions**
- Placement of **macros, memories, and IP blocks**
- Creation of **keep-out zones, halos**, and **blockages**
- Creation of **Site rows**, placement **well-tap cells**, and **Boundary cells**.
- Initial setup for **power grid planning**

A robust floorplan not only minimizes routing congestion and timing bottlenecks but also helps achieve better design closure across corners and modes.

---

## üéØ Purpose and Objectives

The floorplan serves several critical purposes:

- üß≠ Define **core area and die size** based on utilization targets
- üìå Strategically place **macros, memories, and hard IPs** to minimize timing and routing congestion
- ‚ö° Prepare the design for **power planning** by defining boundaries and power domains
- üö´ Insert **halos, keep-out margins, and blockages** to reserve space for routing and avoid overlaps
- üîÄ Enable optimal **logic-to-physical correlation** to improve proximity for critical nets and timing paths

## üéØ Targets and Outcomes

During this stage, the following key targets are achieved:

| Target                                | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚öñÔ∏è Area-Congestion Balance             | Maximize utilization without overloading placement and routing resources    |
| üèÅ White Space Allocation              | Leave enough space for CTS and congestion relief                            |
| ‚ö° Power Grid Channels                 | Ensure open regions for robust VDD/VSS routing                              |
| üìê Hierarchical Partitioning           | Align layout organization with netlist hierarchy                            |

Upon completion, the floorplan acts as a scaffold for the rest of the flow: **placement**, **clock tree synthesis**, and **routing**, especially under **multi-corner multi-mode (MCMM)** analysis.

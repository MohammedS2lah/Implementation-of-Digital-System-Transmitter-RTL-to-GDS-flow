# Data Setup and NDM Creation Stage

This stage marks the transition from front-end design (RTL/synthesis) to back-end physical implementation. It establishes a unified design environment in the form of an **NDM (New Data Model)**, enabling smooth execution of the upcoming Place & Route phases within **Synopsys IC Compiler II (ICC2)**.

---

## üìå Overview

The **Data Setup and NDM Creation** stage is responsible for importing, and translating all design data into the ICC2 flow. This includes netlists, constraints, technology libraries, and physical abstracts. The unified NDM database created during this stage forms the backbone for accurate floorplanning, powerplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis (CTS), and routing.

---

## üéØ Purpose and Objectives

The key goals of this stage are:

- üîÑ **Front-End Data Translation**: Convert RTL and synthesis outputs into ICC2-ready inputs.
- üì• **Library & Abstract Import**: Load and align Liberty, Milkyway, and LEF/DEF views.
- üß± **NDM Initialization**: Create a hierarchical or flat design database in NDM format.
- üß™ **Cross-View Validation**: Ensure logical, physical, and timing views are synchronized for MCMM analysis.

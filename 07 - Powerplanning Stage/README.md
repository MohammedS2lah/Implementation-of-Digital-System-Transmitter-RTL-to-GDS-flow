# Power Planning Stage

The **Power Planning** stage is a foundational part of physical implementation, directly following floorplanning. It defines how power (VDD) and ground (VSS) are delivered across the design, ensuring a robust, reliable, and signoff-quality power distribution network (PDN). Power integrity at this stage is critical for maintaining chip functionality under all operating and process conditions.

## üìå Overview

Once the physical layout from the floorplan is defined, power planning builds the infrastructure that delivers current to all logic cells, macros, and I/Os. This includes designing:
- **Power rings** around the core or macros.
- **Stripes (power rails)** spanning horizontally and vertically.
- **Vias and connections** across metal layers to ensure low impedance paths.

The plan must also account for **IR drop**, **electromigration (EM)**, and **metal layer constraints**, especially in dense or high-current regions.

## üéØ Purpose and Objectives

The key objectives of the power planning stage are:

-  **Build the power grid** to evenly distribute VDD and VSS across the chip.
-  **Maintain power integrity** by avoiding IR drop and EM violations.
-  **Support power domains** and voltage islands where applicable.
-  **Connect macros and IP blocks** to the global power grid using power rings and straps.
-  **Reserve space for decap cells and tie cells** to manage switching noise and enhance stability.

|  Target                                  | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  Multi-layer Grid Design                 | Distribute VDD/VSS across top and lower metal layers                        |
|  Focus on High-Current Regions           | Provide more straps in areas with dense switching activity                  |
|  Resource-aware Planning                 | Minimize impact on signal routing while reserving wide stripes              |
|  Reduce IR Drop and EM Risk              | Ensure design meets reliability constraints over all corners and conditions |

The outcome is a **scalable and optimized power infrastructure**, ready to support standard cell placement, CTS, and full routing with minimal rework. A solid power plan ensures long-term chip stability and manufacturing robustness.

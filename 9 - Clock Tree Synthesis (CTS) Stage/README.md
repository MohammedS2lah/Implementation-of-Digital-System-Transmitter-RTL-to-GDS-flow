# Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS) Stage

The **Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)** stage is a cornerstone of the physical design process. Unlike signal nets, clock nets demand meticulous planning and routing due to their direct impact on the timing of every sequential element in the design. CTS is responsible for transforming the ideal clock source into a physically balanced, low-skew distribution network across the entire chip.

---

## üìå Overview

CTS builds the actual clock distribution tree post-placement by inserting buffers, inverters, and clock gating elements to guide the clock signal from its root (e.g., PLL or clock pad) to all flip-flops and sequential elements. It aims to maintain uniform clock arrival times while balancing power and timing budgets.

---

## üéØ Purpose

The CTS stage is designed to:
-  **Distribute clock signals** evenly and predictably across all clock sinks.
-  **Minimize clock skew**, ensuring all flip-flops operate synchronously.
-  **Support clock gating** logic for dynamic power savings.
-  **Manage latency** to preserve setup and hold timing margins.
-  **Optimize buffer insertion** to minimize power while maintaining signal integrity.
